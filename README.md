# US Bike Rental Dataset
Many U.S. cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.You can download the data from the University of California, Irvine's website. The file contains 17380 rows and each row represents the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day.

The primary target for our predictive models will be the 'cnt' column, which is the total number of bike rentals at a given hour. 'Casual' and 'Registered' columns adds up to total number of bike rentals.
